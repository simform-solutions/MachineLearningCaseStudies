# Movie Recommendation

Netflix is all about connecting people to the movies they love. To help customers find those movies,they developed world-class movie recommendation system: CinematchSM. Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. Netflix use those predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customerâ€™s unique tastes.And while Cinematch is doing pretty well, it can always be made better. 

## Problem Statement 

Netflix provided a lot of anonymous rating data, and we have to improve the accuracy which predicts the user ratings . 
(Accuracy is a measurement of how closely predicted ratings of movies match subsequent actual ratings.)


## Objective 

1. Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he ahs not yet rated.
2. Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE)

## Data

Data Files :
- combined_data_1.txt
- combined_data_2.txt
- combined_data_3.txt
- combined_data_4.txt
- movie_titles.csv

First line of each file [combined_data_1.txt, combined_data_2.txt, combined_data_3.txt, combined_data_4.txt] contains the movie id followed by a colon.
Each subsequent line in the file corresponds to a rating from a customer and its date in the following format:
- CustomerID,Rating,Date

MovieIDs range from 1 to 17770 sequentially.
CustomerIDs range from 1 to 2649429, with gaps. There are 480189 users.
Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
Dates have the format YYYY-MM-DD.

## Type of Machine Learning Problem 

For a given movie and user we need to predict the rating would be given by him/her to the movie. The given problem is a Recommendation problem .It can also seen as a Regression problem 

## Performance Metric 

* Mean Absolute Percentage Error: [MAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error)
* Root Mean Square Error: [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation)


## Approach 

Recommendation systems are based on two approaches : Content Based and Collaborative filtering methods . 
When to use which approach ?
- Collaborative Based : An item is recommended to user based on user-user similarity or item-item similarity . 
Example : In this case-study the similarity  was  **Ratings** . Assume you are a user and you rate a TV series like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad  a rating of 4 . Then How Netflix will recommend further items for binge watching . To solve this problem , it will find similar users who have given same ratings as you have given to GoT and based on his content that the particular user has watched , it will recommend you .

- Content Based : An item is recommended to user based on content .
Example : Assuming you are a New user who has recently joined Netflix and you haven't rated a single show . So how Netflix will decide which content to recommend you . Basically what happens when you sign up , Netflix asks you which type of movies you like and you select some X movies and based on the genre of movie , it will recommend you new shows . This problem is called **COLD START PROBLEM**

## Example

* Movie-Movie similarity based on ratings given by dfferent users .
( Only on similarity of ratings a similar movie is recommended . Genre is not considered . )

1. Shaolin Soccer :

2. Shawshank Redemption :

3. Jurassic Park 3 :

## Usage 

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Cold Start Problem
* Similarity
* Applying ML Models for rating predictions
